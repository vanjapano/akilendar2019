    		<h1> <strong>Your January Horoscope</strong></a> </h2>
        <p>The January 5th new moon and solar eclipse will affect partnered Cancers a bit stronger than their single counterparts. This eclipse occurs in your house of relationships, but don’t fear! It coincides with a new moon so you may find yourself taking your connection to the next level. On the 7th, Venus your personal planet of home and family links up with Jupiter, your planet of health and work. You’re in the mood to pick up a new healthy habit. Don’t set yourself a resolution - try out a few different options before committing to anything! On the 18th, sweet Venus trines with fiery Mars, lifting your energy at work. Venus is responsible for elevating your home while Mars is in charge of moving things along in your work. Make sure that you have a pen ready! The Sun, your personal planet of cash moves into your eighth house of taxation, and other people’s money on the 20th. Put that credit card down and pay off any outstanding bills you have - you’ll feel freer. The lunar eclipse on the 21st will reveal more money matters to you.</p>
